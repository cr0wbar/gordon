# gordon
A Markov chain text generator similar to the [Mark V. Shaney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_V._Shaney) 
synthetic USENET user. `gordon` reads words from an input file and writes an arbitrary number of words to
another file.
The output does not make any sense most of the times, and usually offers some hilarious mix-ups.

##Examples

###Iliad (Italian)
`Anfimaco a costor l'onda 
marina. Ditene adesso, o Dive, i valorosi d'Alo e d'Alope 
e del sacro Ilio sia nostra la colpa, ma di 
bronzo ha la coscia`

###The old man and the sea (English)
`A pot of yellow gulf 
weed with the one hand because of his shoulders and 
then made it fast to bow and rested there. Then 
the weight of his great dignity. I do not have 
a harder life than we do except for the eyes.`
